-- Since RLS is disabled, we don't strictly need policies,
-- but it's good practice to keep them in case RLS is re-enabled.
-- We will ensure 'select', 'insert', 'update', 'delete' are allowed.
-- Note: The service role (which the backend uses) bypasses RLS anyway, 
-- but this change helps avoid issues if the key used changes.
-- For now, simply disabling is the most direct fix for the reported error.
